- This setup is widely used in production grade environments for monitoring large scale platforms.

This includes:
- HA prometheus with remote write enabled.
- Alerting Pipeline in place for quick alerts with defining groups, recievers, silencing.
- Grafana suppoting as single pane of glass for multi-cluster environment visualising metrics at one place, Also easy building custom dashboards
- Operator checking components health and submitting new prometheus rules defined and updating in prometheus
- Supporing push gateway for pulling metrics by custom scripts
- Node level metrics and app level metrics with kube-state with end-end almost real time visibility on CPU, memory, Network, Disks


Thanos:
- Sidecar with prometheus for metrics retention in object store
- Multiple storegateways with time based partitions for quick access of metric results for 2 months.
- 

DrawBacks:
- Reliability Issues ( OOM Kills, slow queries, alerting failures )
- Query failure rates
- avg read latencies
- slow recovery ( slow WAL replays )
