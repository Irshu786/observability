- This architecture needs to be gone through once

VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable time series database. It can be used as a long-term remote storage for Prometheus.

It is recommended to use the single-node version instead of the cluster version for ingestion rates lower than a million data points per second. 
The single-node version scales perfectly with the number of CPU cores, RAM and available storage space. 
The single-node version is easier to configure and operate compared to the cluster version, so think twice before choosing the cluster version.

There is also user-friendly database for logs - VictoriaLogs .

Prominent features:
Supports all the features of the single-node version
Performance and capacity scale horizontally.
Supports multiple independent namespaces for time series data (aka multi-tenancy).
Supports replication.

Architecture overview
VictoriaMetrics cluster consists of the following services:

vmstorage - stores the raw data and returns the queried data on the given time range for the given label filters
vminsert - accepts the ingested data and spreads it among vmstorage nodes according to consistent hashing over metric name and all its labels
vmselect - performs incoming queries by fetching the needed data from all the configured vmstorage nodes


Each service may scale independently and may run on the most suitable hardware. vmstorage nodes don’t know about each other, don’t communicate with each other and 
don’t share any data. 
This is a shared nothing architecture . It increases cluster availability, and simplifies cluster maintenance as well as cluster scaling.

Note that vmselect despite being stateless still requires some disk space (a few GBs) for temporary caches. Refer to the -cacheDataPath command-line flag for more details.


vmui
VictoriaMetrics cluster version provides UI for query troubleshooting and exploration. The UI is available at http://<vmselect>:8481/select/<accountID>/vmui/ in each vmeselect service.
The UI allows exploring query results via graphs and tables. See more details about vmui .
