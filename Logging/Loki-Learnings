## Logging architecture using Loki

Grafana Loki is a set of open source components that can be composed into a fully featured logging stack. 
- A small index and highly compressed chunks simplifies the operation and significantly lowers the cost of Loki.


Unlike other logging systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing metadata about your logsâ€™ labels (just like Prometheus labels). 
Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) or Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or even locally on the filesystem.
