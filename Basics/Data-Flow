We will understand the flow of data being pulled, stored and accessed from clients from prometheus

Data Pushing Process:

- Prometheus is responsible to pull the metrics from collectors, smons and external endpoints paths.
- Based on the scrape interval (15seconds) It will pull the data and
i) Initially will append the blocks in Write Ahead Log(WAL)file inside /data/wal/ - To prevent data loss
ii) At the same time, Prometheus keeps the data in RAM (Head Memory) for fast access for last 2 hours of data
iii) For each 2 hours, prometheus saves this in-memory data (RAM) to disk in a permanent format called TSDB- /var/lib/prometheus


Targets - [ Scraped By Prometheus ] --> [ WAL ] + [ IN-MEMORY]
            Each 2hr -> Permanent TSDB

Data Pulling Process:

Clients will fetch the data based on the time range
a) If within less than 2 hours, Data gets serverd from RAM
b) Older data from storage directory ( default retention: 10days)
